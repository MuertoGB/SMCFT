## Bootable USB creation:

To begin, format a USB disk in ExFAT, FAT32, VFAT or HFS+ for use with SMCFT.
> âš  FAT32 using a GUID Partition Table (GPT) is recommended.

Once the memory stick is ready, you can do any of the following:
- Option A: Manually copy all files from the ISO to the formatted memory stick.
- Option B: Write the image to the memory stick with ddrescue, Passmark imageUSB, or similar.
- Option C: Use a bootable USB creation tool and select the ISO, or image as the source file, and the memory stick as the destination.
